### Project Summary

GloBox is an online marketplace that specialises in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world. Their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue. The Growth team decided to run an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category with a banner at the top of the website.

* Platform 
    * The experiment was ran on the mobile website.
* Duration: 
   * 25 January 2023 - 6 February 2023 (12 days).
* Groups:
    * Control Group: 24,343 users.
    * Treatment Group: 24,600 users.
    * Total Sample Size: 48,943 users.
* Random Assignment: 
    * Users were randomly assigned to either the control or treatment group upon visiting the home page. The page loads the banner for the treatment group and no banner for the control group.
* Metrics Measured:
    * Average amount of dollars spent by a user.
    * Average conversion rate (a purchase made on the day of joining the experiment or days later was considered a conversion).

### Results

* Average Amount Spent: The treatment group showed a $0.02 increase, which was not statistically significant.

* Conversion Rate: The treatment group showed a 0.71% increase, which was statistically significant.

### Recommendation
Based on the significant increase in conversion rate, it is recommended to proceed with the use of the banner. However, further adjustments and optimisations should be considered to maximise its impact. See the attached report for further details.
