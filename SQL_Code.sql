/*
Relevance
Determining the start and end date of the A/B test is crucial for analysing and understanding the impact of any changes or interventions during the experiment. These dates help to precisely assess the results and provide context to the stakeholders when interpreting the cost of running the banner and weigh up the potential of a novelty effect.

If we did not factor in user idâ€™s appearing multiple times, we would not get an accurate representation of desired test metrics. Specifically, the conversion rate would appear much higher than the true value, misrepresenting findings to stakeholders.

Understanding the total, control and treatment sample sizes is crucial when evaluating the reliability of the experiment and when conducting subsequent statistical tests. These sample size values will be essential for assessing the experiments validity and statistical significance, helping to guide further interpretations on relevance to the wider population.

Relevance
Understanding the average amount spent per user is crucial in assessing the impact of the A/B test on user spending behaviour. By including all users, irrespective of their conversion status, the metric provides an accurate representation of spending trends, which will help us compare the performance of the control and treatment group, enabling us to make informed decisions.
